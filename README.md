# Bike Sharing Business Opportunity
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
Kate and I thought that a bike sharing business for our hometown, Des Moines, Iowa, would be a great idea. We created our business proposal for how the business might work based on the bike sharing business in New York City, Citibike. The utilization of Tableau allowed us to create multiple visualizations for the potential investor in our company.

## Summary
In our analysis of the New York City bike sharing company, Citibike, we found that male primarily use Citibike. People utilize the bikes the most during 5:00pm and 7:00pm with a duration of 5 minutes. Thursday is the most active day of the week for the company. Additionally, subscribers use Citibike more than customers do. From this, we can infer that locals are using the bikes more than tourists. One visualization that would provide more insight is the top starting locations for bike rides broken down by Usertype. This information would provide a better understanding of the best location to establish bike hubs based on usage. Another useful visualization would be average trip duration broken down by gender and Usertype.
