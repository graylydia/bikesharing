# Bike Sharing Business Opportunity
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
Kate and I thought that a bike sharing business for our hometown, Des Moines, Iowa, would be a great idea. We created our business proposal for how the business might work based on the bike sharing business in New York City, Citibike. The utilization of Tableau allowed us to create multiple visualizations for the potential investor in our company.
